# Predictive-Modeling-of-Air-Quality-Index-Using-Regression-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the air quality index (AQI) using regression analysis techniques in Python. The goal is to develop accurate models that can predict the AQI based on various independent variables. The objective of this project was to examine the relationship between air quality parameters and the AQI, a crucial metric for assessing air pollution levels. In pursuit of accurate predictions, three regression models were utilized: linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression. By leveraging Python's powerful libraries and statistical functions, this project aimed to explore the effectiveness of these models in capturing the complex dynamics of air quality factors and their impact on the AQI. Through a comprehensive analysis, valuable insights were gained to enhance our understanding of the relationship between air quality parameters and the resulting AQI values, ultimately contributing to improved air pollution management and public health measures.
